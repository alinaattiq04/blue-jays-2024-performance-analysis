- Team value is highly concentrated: The top 5 hitters account for ~71% of total hitter WAR, meaning overall position-player value is driven by a small core rather than spread evenly across the lineup.

- Clear top performer: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is the most valuable hitter by WAR (6.2) and also an elite production leader (OPS .940, OPS+ 164) with a full-time workload (PA 697).

- WAR is not the same as “best bat”: Several high-WAR contributors (e.g., Daulton Varsho at WAR 5.0) have average-to-below-average OPS+ (Varsho OPS+ 96), suggesting WAR value is being supported by non-batting components (e.g., defense/positional value) in addition to offense.

- Small-sample OPS+ inflation exists: Jonatan Clase ranks #1 in OPS+ (178) but with very low playing time (PA 23) and low WAR (0.2), so rate-stat leaders should be interpreted using a PA minimum threshold.

- Efficiency vs volume pattern: The WAR vs PA scatter shows a general tendency for higher WAR among higher-PA players, but there are exceptions—some players provide meaningful value with fewer PAs (e.g., Nathan Lukes: OPS+ 131 on PA 91, WAR 1.2), while others accumulate large PA with modest WAR (e.g., George Springer: PA 614, WAR 1.1, OPS+ 91).

- Depth signal: After the top few contributors, WAR drops quickly (the 10th-ranked hitters are near ~1 WAR), indicating limited mid-tier value and reinforcing the “core-driven” roster profile for hitters.
